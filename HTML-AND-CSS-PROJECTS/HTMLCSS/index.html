                        Grace Hopper, a trailblazer in computer science and one of the first women to reach the rank of
                        Rear Admiral in the U.S. Navy, revolutionized technology with her visionary work on programming
                        languages. Known as the “mother of COBOL,” Hopper led the development of one of the first
                        compiler tools and sparked innovation with her idea of machine-independent languages, making
                        computing widely accessible. Her legacy as a mentor and technical leader transformed the field,
                        and her story inspires continued exploration and advancement in computer science.

        <!-- Early Life and Education -->
        <div class="info-tile" id="early-life">
            <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
            <p>
                Grace Hopper was born in New York City in 1906, demonstrating an early passion for mathematics and
                engineering. After graduating from Vassar College with degrees in mathematics and physics, she continued
                to Yale, where she earned her master’s and, in 1934, a Ph.D. in mathematics. During a time when few
                women pursued higher education in these fields, Hopper’s persistence set her on a path toward
                groundbreaking contributions. Her academic rigor and visionary thinking would soon influence fields she
                had yet to explore, including the nascent field of computing.

            <h3>Career</h3>
            <p>
                During World War II, Hopper joined the U.S. Navy Reserve, seeking new challenges to apply her
                mathematical expertise. Assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project at Harvard, she became
                one of the first programmers on the Harvard Mark I, a pioneering electromechanical computer. It was here
                that she famously coined the term “debugging” after removing an actual moth from the machine’s circuits.
                Later, she played a central role in developing the first compiler, a revolutionary advancement that laid
                the foundation for COBOL, one of the earliest high-level programming languages. This development
                transformed software, making it accessible beyond technical experts and helping the language become a
                standard in business applications. Hopper's career continued into the Navy, where she reached the rank
                of Rear Admiral and became an outspoken advocate for innovation and machine-independent languages.

        <!-- Retirement -->
        <div class="info-tile" id="retirement">
            <h3>Retirement and Legacy</h3>
            <p>
                Hopper retired from the Navy multiple times, only to be called back due to her expertise. After retiring
                permanently at age 79, she became a popular speaker, known for her wit and her famous “nanosecond”
                demonstration, explaining the limits of computing speed. Her influence extended far beyond her formal
                work as she mentored future generations, especially women, in computer science. Her legacy lives on
                through initiatives like the Grace Hopper Celebration, a conference dedicated to empowering women in
                tech, solidifying her status as a cultural icon and a pioneering force in both military and technology
                sectors.

            <p>
                In her 1982 NSA lecture titled Future Possibilities: Data, Hardware, Software, and People, Captain Grace
                Hopper shared her vision of computing's potential. She discussed the need for adaptable programming
                languages and independent data systems, emphasizing a future where computers would handle more complex
                tasks with enhanced speed and efficiency. Hopper highlighted not just the technical aspects but the
                vital human role in advancing technology, urging her audience to innovate fearlessly. Her foresight
                proved instrumental as computing evolved towards greater integration, speed, and accessibility. Long
                thought lost to time because it was recorded on media no longer supported by modern playback equipment,
                the lecture was recently recovered and released to the world. You can watch it in tow parts below.
