### Basic C# Programs

This folder contains numerous basic C# programs demonstrating the fundamentals of the C# programming language.

### Twenty-One Game Application

This project is a console application that mimics the card game Twenty-One. Along with the business logic to play the game, the application also features local and database logging.

### Tech Academy Students Application

This project is an MVC web application that introduces Model constructors.

### Newsletter Signup Application

This project is an MVC web application that mimics a website's newletter signup form. The application takes a user's input and inserts it into a database. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the sign ups to the newletter. The admin view omits sensitive data from the view to protect the customers.

### Tech Store Inventory Application

This project is an MVC web application that introduces Entity Framework. The application mimics a retail store's inventory system and allows the user to perform CRUD operations on the inventory list.

### Car Insurance Quote Application

This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes a user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

### C# Challenge Assignment

The challenge here was to spin up an ASP.NET Core web application and publish it to Azure.

### C# Final Challenge Assignment

The challenge here was to create a basic Entity Framework Code-First console application that creates a basic Student database and adds one student.
